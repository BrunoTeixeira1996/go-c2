# Todo

- Define commands to send to clients in a simple way (`useClient`) maybe with a map?

- Server could exit but clients should continue running and when server starts again, goes check what clients are still on

- Implement mutexes to control goroutines

- Implement command encription on server and command decription on client with one time key given on c2 server startup
