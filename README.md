# go-c2

Wanted to understand some concepts about golang so I decided to make this project for learning purposes only.
The main goal here is to learn and improve some security/programming concepts as well as implement new stuff on the way to increase my knowledge.

## Architecture

The architecture is represented in `arq.svg` but note that this could change as this was only a draft of my initial plan.

## Note

- The goal here is not to make this usable for anyone but to learn.
- I will keep the `TODO.md` updated with bugs and stuff I want to improve but I might not improve it, who knows.
- This c2 is not finished and it's an ongoing project.
